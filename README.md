# 🚦 Arduino Traffic Light Controller



## 📝 Description
This project consists of a simulated traffic light system built using a test board (breadboard) and an Arduino Uno. The logic is programmed using the Arduino programming language to control the timing and sequence of the LEDs, perfectly mimicking a real-world traffic light intersection. It's a hands-on project that bridges the gap between hardware wiring and software logic.

## 🛠️ Languages and Utilities Used
- **Arduino IDE** (Integrated Development Environment)
- **C/C++** (Arduino Programming Language)

## 🖥️ Environments Used
- **Windows 11**

## 🧰 Hardware Components Used
- **1x** Arduino Uno Board
- **1x** Breadboard
- **3x** LEDs (1 Red, 1 Yellow, 1 Green)
- **3x** 220Ω Resistors
- Male-to-Male Jumper Wires
